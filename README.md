  ## Installation 
  First, you will want to clone the repo to your own machine. Open the repo with VS Code, and right click the folder and click "Open in integrate terminal." Run npm init and npm install so that the inquirer package will run properly. 

  ## Usage
  All you need to do is type "node ./index.js". After that, you will be prompted with questions to fill out the readMe. It is designed to create an initial draft of a professional ReadMe document. It is recommended you edit and finalize the document for publication if that is your intent. 
  
  ## Technologies Used
  Node.JS and npm were used in this project, including the use of the package "inquirer." Inquirer is a package that allows you to code in questions for the user to answer. You can then program the application to store the answers and lead the user to certain paths based on their answers. For this project, inquirer leads the user through what they want on their ReadMe, then sends those answers to populate the document.
